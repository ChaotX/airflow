  # We are limiting pyarrow to versions that are also supported by apache-beam provider
  # This aids pypi resolver to focus on small number of pyarrow versions
  - pyarrow>=9.0.0;python_version<"3.11"
  # Pyarrow needs version 11.0.0+ for Python 3.11 - for now beam provider is disabled for 3.11
  # altogether, but this limit will have to be bumped anyway when they add support for 3.11
  - pyarrow>=11.0.0;python_version>="3.11"

# Excluded because apache-beam and a number of dependent libraries are not
# compatible with 3.11 yet. See https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/23848
